# LLM Application Builder

This project is a fully automated web application builder that receives API requests, uses an AI model (via aipipe.org) to generate complete web applications, and deploys them to GitHub Pages. It supports multi-round revisions, file attachments, and asynchronous processing.

## üéØ Project Summary

This application serves as a powerful backend service that automates the entire lifecycle of creating and deploying simple web applications. A user sends a JSON request describing an application, and the service handles the rest:

1.  **Receives Request:** A Flask API endpoint accepts a JSON payload with the application brief.
2.  **Generates Code:** It calls the `aipipe.org` API to generate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and documentation based on the brief.
3.  **Handles Attachments:** Decodes and includes file attachments (like images) from the request.
4.  **Deploys to GitHub:** Creates a new public GitHub repository, commits the generated files, and enables GitHub Pages.
5.  **Asynchronous Workflow:** Immediately acknowledges the request and performs the build in the background to prevent timeouts.
6.  **Notifies on Completion:** Sends a POST request to a specified `evaluation_url` with the deployment details.
7.  **Supports Revisions:** Handles multi-round requests to revise and update the same application.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Uses `aipipe.org` (with GPT-4) to generate application code.
-   **Automated GitHub Deployment:** Creates repositories and deploys to GitHub Pages automatically.
-   **Asynchronous Processing:** Handles long-running build jobs in a background thread for a non-blocking API.
-   **File Attachment Support:** Can decode Base64 data URIs and include files in the generated project.
-   **Multi-Round Revisions:** Supports iterative development by accepting "Round 2" requests to modify existing applications.
-   **Resilient Notifications:** Includes a retry mechanism with exponential backoff when notifying evaluation services.
-   **Secure Configuration:** Manages all secret keys (API keys, tokens) using a `.env` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your secret keys.

```bash
# .env file

# Get your token from https://aipipe.org/
AIPIPE_API_KEY="your-aipipe-token-here"

# Create a GitHub token with repo, workflow, and admin:repo_hook scopes
GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-personal-access-token-here"

# Create a strong, unique secret for validating requests
SECRET_KEY="your-custom-secret-key-here"
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### 1. Start the Application

Run the Flask server from your terminal.

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Send a Build Request

Use a tool like `curl` to send a JSON request to the build endpoint.

#### Round 1: Initial Build

This command will create a new application.

```bash
curl -X POST https://llm-app-builder-production.up.railway.app/api/build -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample_request.json
```
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://llm-app-builder-production.up.railway.app/api/build" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body (Get-Content -Raw -Path "sample_request.json")
```

You will receive an immediate response with a `project_id`.

#### Round 2: Revise the Application

After the first round is complete, send the second request to modify the application. *Specify "Round":2*

```bash
curl -X POST https://llm-app-builder-production.up.railway.app/api/build -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @sample_request.json
```
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://llm-app-builder-production.up.railway.app/api/build" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body (Get-Content -Raw -Path "sample_request.json")
```

### 3. Check the Status

You can check the progress of a build using the `/api/status/<project_id>` endpoint.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/status/your-project-id-here
```

## üîå API Endpoints

-   **`POST /api/build`**: The main endpoint to request a new build or a revision. It accepts a JSON body and initiates the build process in the background.
-   **`GET /api/status/<project_id>`**: Returns the current status of a build (`processing`, `completed`, or `failed`) and the final deployment details.
-   **`GET /api/projects`**: Lists all projects that have been processed by the service.
-   **`GET /health`**: A health check endpoint that confirms the server is running and API keys are configured.

---

## üíª Code Explanation

-   **`build_application()`**: The main API endpoint that validates the request, starts the background processing thread, and returns an immediate `202 Accepted` response.
-   **`process_build_request()`**: The core function that runs in the background. It orchestrates the entire workflow: calling the LLM, creating the repository, and notifying the evaluation service.
-   **`generate_app_with_llm()`**: Constructs the prompt and calls the `aipipe.org` API to generate the application code.
-   **`create_github_repo()`**: Handles all interactions with the GitHub API, including creating/updating files, handling attachments, and enabling GitHub Pages.
-   **`notify_evaluation_service()`**: Sends the final notification to the `evaluation_url` with a robust retry mechanism.
-   **`repair_json_string()`**: A utility function to fix common formatting errors in the AI model's JSON response.
